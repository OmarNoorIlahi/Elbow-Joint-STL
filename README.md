## Overview

This is Task Four in the Mechanical Engineering track, submitted to Smart Methods Company for 2025 Summer Internship. This task presents an STL file format of the elbow joint design from Task Three. Furthermore, it provides appropriate material selection for printing with clarified reasons, along with the features of the printed part. Screenshots from the printing software illustrating the printing settings are also attached.

## Methods

First of all, the model is saved as an STL file format from SolidWorks. Then, it is inserted into Creality software. 

### Creality

Creality is a Chinese company specializing in 3D printing. The company develops its own 3D printers along with proprietary software. However, users are not required to own a Creality printer to install the software, as it is available for free. The program offers many features, including:  

- Auto positioning of the part to determine whether support structure is needed or not.  
- Auto nozzle calibration based on the size of the part, whether large or small.  
- Auto adjustment of layer height, allowing for fine or coarse prints.  
- Auto selection of infill & shells type.  

Regardless of these features, they can be modified based on the user’s purposes. 

### Printing Setting

The following steps show the printing setting process with screenshots.

Figure 1 displays the default setting of Creality when the part is inserted into. Clicking on “Auto” button, positions the part with the suitable attitude for the support as shown in Figure 2 below.

Figure 2 shows the auto-position settings of the part, highlighting its orientation, layer height, and infill and shell configurations on the right side of the image. The load applied to the part is vertical, distributed layer by layer. Since the part is small, a fine layer height is used. The infill and shell structures are automatically set to a triangular grid pattern.

## Material

The proper material for printing is **Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG)** due to the following properties:  

- **Good strength & stiffness:** the material can handle loads under stress up to 53 MPa, so it will not be damaged easily.  
- **High resistance:** the material can resist high temperatures, water, chemicals, and fatigue, making it suitable for tough environments.  
- **High printability:** most parts printed with this material are easy to print because no hardened nozzle is required.  
- **Affordable & reliable:** compared with other materials, PETG is cheaper and more available for rapid manufacturing.  

The following figure shows the printing setting for PETG material:

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 3: PETG Setting</b></p>

On the left side of Figure 3, the printing details are highlighted. A total time of 57 minutes for printing, consuming 16.2 grams of the PETG filament.

## Features

When the joint is printed with PETG, it will have the following characteristics:

- Light weight.  
- Durability which increases the resilience of the part to absorb shocks.  
- Good surface finish, reducing cracks on the surfaces.  
- Stable dimensions, which means precise fitting for holes and pins and less tolerances.
